Here I have some exercises with Java to understand the data types it uses, 
such as Primitive data and Reference data.

src -> is the standard folder where the project's source files are stored.

C20110625 -> is a folder of "C20 for Cohort 20" and the date June 11, 2025.

In the folder C20110625 I have the first exercises with Java.
